/*
Create a program similar to the previous one except that it multiplies the two numbers instead of adding them.

For example, if the variables hold numbers 2 and 8, the program output should be:

2 * 8 = 16
        
If the variables hold numbers 277 and 111, the program output should be:

277 * 111 = 30747
