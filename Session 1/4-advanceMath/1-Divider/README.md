#Divider
Create a program that asks the user for two integers and prints their quotient. Make sure that 3 / 2 = 1.5. If the decimal part is missing, take another look at 6.1 Floating point numbers (decimal numbers) to find the solution.

Type a number: 3
Type another number: 2

Division: 3 / 2 = 1.5
